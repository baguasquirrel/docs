### App Store multiple users

This problem occurs when more than one App Store account is used to install software on a single machine.

I chose to add the following apps as a Pivotal Labs account (all other software was installed with my personal account):

1. Wunderlist
1. Twitter
1. Pocket
1. Evernote
1. Mint QuickView
1. Composure
1. Simplenote
1. 123DMake
2. Sketchbook Express
3. Adobe Revel

This list was chosent by clicking on the *Great Free Apps* link on the App Store.
