<blockquote>Sign in to download from the App Store

If you have an Apple ID, sign in with it here. If you have used the iTunes Store or iCloud, for example, you have an Apple ID. If you don't have an Apple ID, click Create Apple ID.</blockquote>

This problem occurs when more than one App Store account is used to install software on a single machine.

I chose to add the following apps as a Pivotal Labs account (all other software was installed with my personal account):

1. Wunderlist
1. Twitter
1. Pocket
1. Evernote
1. Mint QuickView
1. Composure
1. Simplenote
1. 123DMake
2. Sketchbook Express
3. Adobe Revel

This list was chosent by clicking on the *Great Free Apps* link on the App Store.
