### A Casual Description of What I Do

I am a good systems administrator. Really good. I have worked for three CTOs at three different startups, all of whom were exceptional systems administrators in their own right, and I was able to create and maintain an environment to their satisfaction&mdash;I am, if you will, a system administrator’s system administrator.

I know how to do my job: I can set my own budget, work within extremely frugal constraints, and keep things running. There has been almost no downtime at the companies at which I have worked, and that’s not because I’m lucky: it’s because I had put thought and effort into making sure that, when things failed, we were prepared.

I see the bigger picture. I'll happily outsource webhosting and email although I am quite capable of bringing them in-house. I purchased a commercial firewall even though I could have built a better one from that old laptop in the corner. I don’t insist that everyone runs Linux. I step in when vendors fail: I spent a week working with Marketing on the new website launch after their web designer had told them that he couldn’t help them anymore.
